# README
    This app was designed as a project for the Turing School of Software and Designto test my ability to implement an
    OAuth system and then consume an API. Once a user logs in with their Twitter account, they will be prompted to entertheir Steam ID or 
    Nickname. The app will use this ID to create a collection of the users' games that have been played for less than 5 minutes and then 
    calculate the total cost of all of those games.
