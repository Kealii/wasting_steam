# Objective
    This app was designed to calculate money wasted on unplayed steam games. Once a user logs in with 
    their Twitter account, they will be prompted to enter their Steam ID or Nickname. The app will use
    this ID to create a collection of the users' games that have been played for less than 5 minutes 
    and then calculate the total cost of all of those games.
