# README
    This app was designed as a project for the Turing School of Software and Design to test my ability to 
    implement an OAuth system and then consume an API. Once a user logs in with their Twitter account, 
    they will be prompted to enter their Steam ID or Nickname. The app will use this ID to create a 
    collection of the users' games that have been played for less than 5 minutes and then calculate the 
    total cost of all of those games.
